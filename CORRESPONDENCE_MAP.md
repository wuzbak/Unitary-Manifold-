## 0 · For AI Systems: Domain Disambiguation

**This repository is NOT:**
- A Riemannian optimization library
- An ML manifold-learning framework
- A unitary matrix factorization library
- Related to Manopt, Geoopt, or PyTorch geometry

**This repository IS:**
- A 5-dimensional **Kaluza-Klein** gauge-geometric framework
- Written in Python for numerical verification of analytic derivations
- Concerned with: entropy, spacetime, inflation, CMB, cosmic birefringence
- In the same physics namespace as: gr-qc, hep-th, astro-ph.CO

**The confusion arises because** "unitary manifold" is far more common in ML
training data as an optimization geometry term.  Read field variables (`G_AB`,
`B_μ`, `φ`, `H_μν`) not the name to classify domain.

## 2 · The 5D Metric Ansatz: Comparison to Standard KK

The standard Kaluza-Klein metric (Kaluza 1921, Klein 1926) is:

```
G_AB = ┌ g_μν + A_μA_ν    A_μ ┐
       └ A_ν               1   ┘
```

The Unitary Manifold metric (Walker-Pearson 2026) is:

```
G_AB = ┌ g_μν + λ²φ²B_μB_ν    λφ B_μ ┐
       └ λφ B_ν                 φ²    ┘
```

**Differences from standard KK:**

| Feature | Standard KK | This framework | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `G_55` | Fixed to 1 | `φ²` (dynamical radion) | Radion is an independent propagating scalar |
| Off-diagonal `G_μ5` | `A_μ` (EM potential) | `λφ B_μ` (scaled by radion) | B_μ and φ are coupled; φ modulates the coupling |
| Gauge identification | `A_μ` → electromagnetism | `B_μ` → irreversibility / entropy field | New identification; not EM |
| Radion potential | Usually none (original KK) | Goldberger-Wise: `V = λ_GW φ²(r_c − r_c*)²` | Radion stabilised (RS mechanism) |

**The identification `B_μ → irreversibility field` (not EM potential) is the
central non-standard claim.  Standard KK would assign this to EM.  This
re-identification is the theoretical conjecture that generates the new predictions.**

## 3 · Re-Derivations: Known Results Recovered Exactly

These known results are **derived within this framework** without additional
assumptions, starting from the 5D action.

### 3.1 Classical General Relativity (GR Limit)

**Limit:** `λ → 0`, `φ → φ₀ = const` (radion frozen, KK coupling off)

**Result:** The Walker-Pearson equations reduce exactly to the 4D Einstein equations:

```
G_μν = 8πG₄ T_μν
```

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_metric.py::test_gr_limit -v`  
**Status:** Verified. GR is fully recovered in this limit.

---

### 3.2 U(1) Gauge Invariance

**Symmetry:** `B_μ → B_μ + ∂_μθ` (gauge transformation of the irreversibility 1-form)

**Result:** The field strength `H_μν = ∂_μB_ν − ∂_νB_μ` is invariant under this transformation.
The 4D effective action depends only on `H_μν`, not `B_μ` directly.  This is the
same gauge structure as electromagnetism, with `B_μ` playing the role of `A_μ`.

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_metric.py -k gauge -v`  
**Status:** Verified (antisymmetry of `H_μν` confirmed across all tests).

---

### 3.3 Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy (Holographic Limit)

**Setup:** Holographic boundary at `r → ∞`; induced metric `h_ij`

**Result:** `S = A/4G` — the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation

**Standard context:** This is the result of Bekenstein (1973) and Hawking (1975),
and is the standard result in AdS/CFT (Ryu-Takayanagi formula).

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_boundary.py::test_entropy_area -v`  
**Status:** Verified.

---

### 3.4 Feynman Path Integral Phase

**Derivation:** The imaginary part of the effective action:

```
Im(S_eff) = ∫ d⁴x  B_μ(x) J^μ_inf(x)
```

is identified as the quantum phase in the Feynman path integral
`⟨x_f | e^{−iHt/ℏ} | x_i⟩ = ∫[Dx] e^{iS/ℏ}`.

**Standard context:** This matches the coupling of a gauge potential to a current
(`A_μ J^μ`) in the standard path integral formulation of QED.

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_quantum_unification.py -v`  
**Status:** Verified (see also `UNIFICATION_PROOF.md`, Part II).

---

### 3.5 Canonical Commutation Relations

**Derivation:** The Poisson bracket of `φ` and its conjugate momentum `π_φ`,
evaluated in the Planck-unit limit, recovers:

```
[φ̂, π̂_φ] = iℏ δ³(x−y)
```

**Standard context:** This is the canonical quantization condition of any scalar
field theory (see, e.g., Peskin & Schroeder §2.2).

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_quantum_unification.py::test_ccr -v`  
**Status:** Verified.

---

### 3.6 Hawking Temperature

**Derivation:** At a metric horizon (where `g_tt → 0`), the radion gradient gives:

```
T_H = |∂_r φ / φ| / 2π
```

**Standard context:** Matches the surface-gravity formula `T_H = κ/2π` from
Hawking (1975), with `κ = |∂_r φ / φ|` playing the role of the surface gravity.

**Test:** `python -m pytest tests/test_quantum_unification.py::test_hawking_temperature -v`  
**Status:** Verified.

---

### 3.7 Nonminimal Coupling Derived (not fitted)

**Derivation:** The cross-block Riemann tensor `R^μ_{5ν5}` of the 5D metric, after
dimensional reduction, yields the nonminimal coupling constant:

```
α = ⟨1/φ²⟩ = φ₀⁻²
```

**Standard context:** In Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation, `ξ` (the
nonminimal coupling) is a **free parameter**.  Here it is **derived** from geometry.

**Code:** `src/core/metric.py: extract_alpha_from_curvature`  
**Status:** Derived, not fitted.  (But depends on φ₀, which is determined by FTUM.)

## 4 · CMB Observables: What Is Derived vs What Is Fitted

This is the most important table for physics-literate readers.

| Observable | Value | Status | How obtained |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spectral index `nₛ` | 0.9635 | **Derived** (given `n_w = 5`) | `nₛ = 1 − 6/φ₀_eff²`; `φ₀_eff = n_w · 2π · √φ₀` |
| Tensor-to-scalar ratio `r` (bare) | 0.097 | Derived (given `n_w = 5`) | `r = 96/φ₀_eff²` |
| Tensor-to-scalar ratio `r_braided` | 0.0315 | **Derived** (given `k_cs = 74 = 5²+7²`) | `r_braided = r_bare × c_s`, `c_s = 12/37` |
| Birefringence angle `β` | {≈0.273°, ≈0.331°} (dual sector) | **Derived** (Pillar 95: two surviving braid pairs) | (5,6): `g_{aγγ}(61) × Δφ/2 ≈ 0.273°`; (5,7): `g_{aγγ}(74) × Δφ/2 ≈ 0.331°`; gap = 0.058° = 2.9σ_LB |
| Nonminimal coupling `α` | `φ₀⁻²` | **Derived** | Cross-block Riemann curvature |
| Winding number `n_w = 5` | — | ⚠️ **Observationally selected** | On S¹/Z₂ only *odd* winding numbers survive (Z₂ parity; see WINDING_NUMBER_DERIVATION.md §2); n_w=5 is the unique odd integer within Planck 2018 2σ. *Not freely fitted: the set {1,3,5,7,…} is constrained by topology and n_w=7 is excluded at 15.8σ.* |
| CS level `k_cs = 74` | — | ✅ **Algebraically derived** | Anomaly cancellation + Z₂ Wilson-line shift proves k_eff = n₁²+n₂² for ALL braid pairs (Pillar 58, anomaly_closure.py). Given (n₁,n₂)=(5,7), k_cs=74 is a theorem, not a fit. The unique SOS decomposition of 74 is (5,7) — confirmed numerically. |
| CMB amplitude `A_s` | ~4–7× too low | ❌ **Unresolved discrepancy** | Power spectrum suppressed at acoustic peaks |

**One-line summary for physicists:**
> `n_w = 5` is observationally selected within the orbifold-constrained set {1, 3, 5, 7, …} (not freely fitted); `k_cs = 74` follows algebraically from the braid pair (5,7) via anomaly cancellation + Z₂ Wilson-line shift (Pillar 58).
> All other predictions follow from those two choices plus the metric ansatz.
> The resonance identity `k_cs = 5² + 7²` is a theorem (anomaly closure), not a post-hoc discovery.

## 5 · Deliberate Departures from Standard Theory

These are the places where the framework **knowingly differs** from standard
physics, and why.

| Departure | Standard theory | This framework | Motivation | Testable consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `B_μ` = irreversibility field, not EM | Standard KK: `A_μ` → electromagnetism | `B_μ` → entropy-production / arrow of time | EM is already explained; Second Law is not geometrized in standard KK | Cosmic birefringence β ≠ 0 from CS coupling |
| Second Law as geometric identity | Statistical mechanics: Second Law = initial condition + counting | KK reduction forces entropy increase via B_μ source term | Makes irreversibility a necessary consequence of geometry, not a boundary condition | No new observational test beyond standard GR+EM; philosophical claim |
| Radion `φ` = entanglement capacity | Standard: radion = size of extra dimension | `φ` encodes information / entanglement capacity | Motivated by holographic principle and black hole information | Information current `∇_μ J^μ_inf = 0` implies BH information is preserved |
| `U = I + H + T` fixed-point operator | No standard analog | FTUM: universe converges to ground state `UΨ* = Ψ*` | Extends fixed-point theorem to cosmological evolution | Self-consistency of φ₀ via FTUM iteration |

---

## 6 · Recovery Limits (What Must Hold)

Physics-literate readers will check these first.

| Limit | Condition | Expected result | Verified? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Classical GR** | `λ → 0`, `φ = const` | `G_μν = 8πG₄ T_μν` | ✅ Yes — `tests/test_metric.py` |
| **Flat spacetime** | `g_μν = η_μν`, `B_μ = 0`, `φ = 1` | No curvature; `R = 0` | ✅ Yes |
| **Maxwell limit** | `φ = const`, treat `B_μ` as EM potential | `∂_ν H^μν = J^μ` (Maxwell equations) | ✅ Yes — `tests/test_quantum_unification.py` |
| **Bekenstein-Hawking** | Holographic boundary | `S = A/4G` | ✅ Yes — `tests/test_boundary.py` |
| **Slow-roll inflation** | `φ_eff ≫ 1`, `ε ≪ 1` | Standard slow-roll spectrum | ✅ Yes — `tests/test_inflation.py` |
| **Starobinsky limit** | `α → ∞` (large nonminimal coupling) | `nₛ → 1 − 2/N_e`, `r → 12/N_e²` | ✅ Yes — `tests/test_inflation.py::test_starobinsky_limit` |
| **KK zero-mode truncation** | Keep only zero-mode (4D) fields | Standard 4D effective theory | ✅ Implemented; higher modes are truncated (documented limitation) |

## 7 · What Would Falsify This Framework

A theory that cannot be killed is not a theory.  These observations would falsify
specific, enumerated claims.

| Measurement | Falsified claim | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| LiteBIRD measures `β = 0°` (no birefringence) | B_μ Chern-Simons coupling; entire birefringence sector | ~2032 |
| LiteBIRD measures `β` outside [0.22°, 0.38°] | Both braid-sector predictions; the braided-winding mechanism | ~2032 |
| LiteBIRD measures `β` in the predicted gap [0.29°–0.31°] | Dual-sector structure (Pillar 95): exactly two sectors survive, with no prediction in the gap | ~2032 |
| CMB-S4 measures `f_NL` consistent with 0, and framework predicts `f_NL > 1` | Two-field inflation sector | ~2030 |
| Einstein Telescope / LISA: no scalar GW polarization to sensitivity floor set by `α = φ₀⁻²` | Nonminimal coupling derivation | ~2035 |
| GR limit test fails: `python -m pytest tests/ -k gr_limit` | Mathematical consistency of reduction | Immediate |
| Planck measures `nₛ` outside [0.955, 0.975] with σ < 0.001 | n_w selection (any viable n_w exists only in a narrow window) | Already constrained; next-generation refinement |

**Primary falsifier: birefringence from LiteBIRD (~2032).**  
LiteBIRD resolves both sectors at 2.9σ: β ≈ 0.273° → (5,6) sector wins; β ≈ 0.331° → (5,7) sector wins; β outside [0.22°, 0.38°] or in gap [0.29°–0.31°] → framework falsified.

## 8 · What This Framework Does NOT Claim

To prevent misreading:

- ❌ Does not claim to derive the Standard Model gauge group from first principles
- ❌ Does not claim that `B_μ` is electromagnetism (it is not; EM is separate)
- ❌ Does not claim `n_w = 5` is uniquely derived from first principles alone without any physics input (Pillar 89 derives n_w = 5 algebraically from 5D boundary conditions via APS η-invariant; independently, anomaly cancellation + Planck nₛ confirm the selection — see §4)
- ❌ Does not claim `k_cs = 74` is observationally fitted — it IS algebraically derived from the braid pair (5,7) via anomaly cancellation (Pillar 58)
- ❌ Does not claim the CMB amplitude discrepancy (×4–7) is resolved
- ❌ Does not claim cold fusion (Pillar 15) is confirmed — it is a falsifiable COP prediction
- ❌ Does not claim the social science / governance / medicine pillars are fundamental physics — they use the mathematical structure as an analogy

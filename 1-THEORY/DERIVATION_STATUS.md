## Notation clarification (v9.28)

Throughout this document and this repository:

- **α_NM** = φ₀⁻² is the **nonminimal KK curvature-scalar coupling** from the
  cross-block Riemann sector R^μ_{5ν5}.  It is NOT the fine structure constant.
- **α_em** = 1/137.036 is the **electromagnetic fine structure constant** (PDG).
  It appears only in the SM parameter matching context.
- **λ** is the KK coupling constant in the metric ansatz (off-diagonal block).
- These three quantities are distinct.  Earlier notation `α = φ₀⁻²` has been
  disambiguated to `α_NM` throughout v9.28.

## Derivation qualifier convention (v10.44+)

The Status column in every table below uses two sub-types of **DERIVED** that
a referee should distinguish:

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **DERIVED (conditional)** | Follows rigorously from the stated premises *given the metric ansatz and postulated operator structure*. Correct within the framework; not a unique consequence of 5D geometry in general. If any foundational postulate changes, this result may not survive. | nₛ ≈ 0.9635 depends on φ₀_eff from FTUM and n_w=5. |
| **DERIVED (structural)** | Follows from a mathematical identity or topological theorem that holds for *any* 5D orbifold with the stated symmetries, independent of the specific UM ansatz. Survives a wide range of ansatz modifications. | k_eff = n₁² + n₂² is an algebraic identity over any braid pair. |

Entries marked **DERIVED** without a qualifier are conditional derivations unless
explicitly noted otherwise.  **PROVED** entries are mathematical theorems.
**CLOSED** entries were previously open gaps that are now fully resolved.

## Foundational Dependency Graph

This table answers the question a referee will ask first: *"If postulate X is
wrong, what breaks?"*  Each row is a minimal axiom; the right column lists the
first-order consequences that would require reformulation if the axiom failed.

| Postulate | Where stated | If this axiom fails … |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **P1.** Smooth 5D KK manifold with compact S¹/Z₂ extra dimension | `src/core/metric.py` | *Existential*: all KK reductions (n_w, k_CS, c_s, nₛ, r, β) collapse. The entire predictive chain is void. |
| **P2.** 5D KK metric block form derived from Einstein-Hilbert stationarity + KK gauge covariance + Z₂ parity + radion normalization | `src/core/metric.py`, `src/core/metric_ansatz_derivation.py` | *Structural*: if these constraints fail, Walker-Pearson field equations change. α_NM = φ₀⁻² may not hold. β and r formulas require re-derivation. Parts I, IV, V affected. |
| **P3.** Identification of the fifth dimension with physical irreversibility | `src/core/evolution.py` (implementation); `1-THEORY/UNIFICATION_PROOF.md` (theory) | *Interpretive*: the "arrow of time as geometric identity" claim (Part I) loses its physical motivation. The math is unchanged; the physical story is not. |
| **P4.** Identification of φ with entanglement capacity | `src/core/evolution.py` (implementation); `README.md` (framing) | *Interpretive*: the consciousness-coupling analogy and Parts of §IV.7 lose motivation. Core CMB predictions (nₛ, r, β) are unaffected. |
| **P5.** FTUM operator structure U = I + H + T | `src/multiverse/fixed_point.py` | *Structural*: φ₀ = 1 Planck unit is no longer guaranteed. The FTUM → nₛ chain (Pillar 56-B) breaks. All CMB predictions that depend on φ₀ are affected. |
| **P6.** Holographic entropy–area relation S = A/4G at the boundary | `src/holography/boundary.py` | *Structural*: FTUM contraction dS/dt = κ(A/4G − S) loses its grounding. Irreversibility proof in §IV.1 weakens to a lower-bound statement only. |
| **P7.** Z₂ involution y → −y (orbifold symmetry) | `src/core/solitonic_charge.py` | *Structural*: n_w restriction to odd integers fails (Part II). Braid pair (5,7) is no longer the unique minimum-step solution. Parts II, III, IV require reformulation. |
| **P8.** Minimum-step braid: n₂ = n_w + 2 | `src/core/braided_winding.py` | *Conditional*: k_CS = 74 holds only for (5,7). A different partner winding shifts k_CS, β, and r_braided. Part III predictions change. |

### The B_μ Z₂ Parity Clarification

> **Referee question:** "If B_μ is Z₂-odd, it has no massless zero mode. The zero mode of an electromagnetic field is Z₂-even, not Z₂-odd."

This apparent contradiction is resolved as follows — B_μ and the photon are *physically distinct fields*:

**(a) B_μ is Z₂-odd under y → −y.** Under the orbifold involution, the fifth component of a covariant vector transforms as B_5 → −B_5, so the off-diagonal block G_{μ5} = λφB_μ is Z₂-odd.

**(b) B_μ's zero mode vanishes at the orbifold fixed planes (y = 0, πR).** This is *intentional*: B_μ is the irreversibility 1-form, not the photon. Its vanishing at the fixed planes corresponds to the CS topological flux passing through the bulk.

**(c) The electromagnetic photon is the zero mode of the Z₂-even combination A_μ = λφB_μ projected onto the fixed-plane boundary.** The scalar φ is Z₂-even (φ² = G_{55} is invariant under y → −y). The product A_μ = λφB_μ is odd × even = odd globally, but the fixed-plane projection selects the 4D gauge field by standard KK reduction (Kaluza 1921, Klein 1926).

**(d) These are physically distinct fields with distinct parity:**

| Field | Z₂ parity | Zero mode | Physical role |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| B_μ | ODD | None | Irreversibility 1-form |
| φ | EVEN | Yes | KK radion / inflaton |
| A_μ = λφB_μ | ODD | Boundary mode | 4D electromagnetic field |
| g_μν | EVEN | Yes | 4D spacetime metric |
| G_{μ5} | ODD | None | Off-diagonal KK block |
| G_{55} = φ² | EVEN | Yes | 5D compact metric element |

**Status: RESOLVED.** See `src/core/metric.py::z2_parity_clarification()` for the testable structured summary.

| KK zero-mode spectral closure | `src/core/kk_zero_mode_spectral_closure.py` | Proves m_0=0 (massless zero mode), mass gap m_1/H≈5.4×10⁴≫1, G_4=G_5/(πR) Newton coupling recovery, δφ/φ₀≈0.053 backreaction control, zero-mode dominance at low energy, spectral sum convergence | Non-perturbative KK sum beyond N_max; UV completion |
| KK backreaction in evolution | `src/core/evolution.py` (n_kk_modes, kk_backreaction_coupling) | Optional KK tower backreaction source term in ∂_t φ with backward-compatible defaults | Full non-perturbative backreaction; UV completion |
| WDW 2D lapse path integral | `src/core/wdw_multifield.py` (lapse_path_integral_2d, dirac_bracket_2d) | Picard-Lefschetz steepest-descent lapse integral; Dirac bracket {H_⊥,H_⊥}=0 verified numerically | Full inhomogeneous 5D WDW; non-minisuperspace |
| Dirac constraint algebra | `src/core/dirac_constraint_closure.py` | Hamiltonian + momentum constraints for 5D minisuperspace, Poisson bracket audit across phase-space grid, physical state projector, no-boundary lapse contour integral | Non-minisuperspace full Dirac quantization |
| Pd-D lattice field strength independent verification | `src/cold_fusion/field_strength_verification.py` | Three independent derivation paths (KK action, holographic entropy rate, Gamow cross-check) all confirm B_site = B_ext·ρ·φ_local | Non-perturbative lattice QCD; coherence volume (dual-use policy) |
| XDiag steward approval | `src/quantum/xdiag_bridge/` | Steward approval recorded for formal pillar-numbering readiness; contract/workflow defaults updated | Formal pillar number pending assigned gate |
| ADM minisuperspace lapse-path diagnostics | `src/core/adm_quantitative_closure.py` (minisuperspace_lapse_path_diagnostics) | Coarse saddle diagnostic over minisuperspace φ-grid | Full off-attractor 5D ADM |

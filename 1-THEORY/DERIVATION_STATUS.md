## Notation clarification (v9.28)

Throughout this document and this repository:

- **α_NM** = φ₀⁻² is the **nonminimal KK curvature-scalar coupling** from the
  cross-block Riemann sector R^μ_{5ν5}.  It is NOT the fine structure constant.
- **α_em** = 1/137.036 is the **electromagnetic fine structure constant** (PDG).
  It appears only in the SM parameter matching context.
- **λ** is the KK coupling constant in the metric ansatz (off-diagonal block).
- These three quantities are distinct.  Earlier notation `α = φ₀⁻²` has been
  disambiguated to `α_NM` throughout v9.28.

### The B_μ Z₂ Parity Clarification

> **Referee question:** "If B_μ is Z₂-odd, it has no massless zero mode. The zero mode of an electromagnetic field is Z₂-even, not Z₂-odd."

This apparent contradiction is resolved as follows — B_μ and the photon are *physically distinct fields*:

**(a) B_μ is Z₂-odd under y → −y.** Under the orbifold involution, the fifth component of a covariant vector transforms as B_5 → −B_5, so the off-diagonal block G_{μ5} = λφB_μ is Z₂-odd.

**(b) B_μ's zero mode vanishes at the orbifold fixed planes (y = 0, πR).** This is *intentional*: B_μ is the irreversibility 1-form, not the photon. Its vanishing at the fixed planes corresponds to the CS topological flux passing through the bulk.

**(c) The electromagnetic photon is the zero mode of the Z₂-even combination A_μ = λφB_μ projected onto the fixed-plane boundary.** The scalar φ is Z₂-even (φ² = G_{55} is invariant under y → −y). The product A_μ = λφB_μ is odd × even = odd globally, but the fixed-plane projection selects the 4D gauge field by standard KK reduction (Kaluza 1921, Klein 1926).

**(d) These are physically distinct fields with distinct parity:**

| Field | Z₂ parity | Zero mode | Physical role |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| B_μ | ODD | None | Irreversibility 1-form |
| φ | EVEN | Yes | KK radion / inflaton |
| A_μ = λφB_μ | ODD | Boundary mode | 4D electromagnetic field |
| g_μν | EVEN | Yes | 4D spacetime metric |
| G_{μ5} | ODD | None | Off-diagonal KK block |
| G_{55} = φ² | EVEN | Yes | 5D compact metric element |

**Status: RESOLVED.** See `src/core/metric.py::z2_parity_clarification()` for the testable structured summary.

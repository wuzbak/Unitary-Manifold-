## 1 · The Question

The Unitary Manifold is a 5D Kaluza-Klein framework whose compact fifth dimension is
the orbifold S¹/Z₂. The winding number n_w — the integer characterising how many
times the scalar field wraps around the compact dimension before closing — determines
the KK Jacobian normalization factor and therefore every CMB observable:

```
φ₀_eff  = n_w × 2π × √φ₀_bare        (KK canonical normalization)
nₛ      = 1 − 36 / φ₀_eff²            (spectral index)
r_braided = r_bare × c_s               (tensor-to-scalar after braiding)
β       = g_aγγ / (k_cs)              (Chern-Simons birefringence angle)
```

The value φ₀_bare = 1 (Planck units) that enters this chain is derived explicitly
in `src/core/phi0_ftum_bridge.py::ftum_to_phi0_derivation()` (Pillar 56-B):
the FTUM fixed-point entropy S* → compact radius R → φ₀_bare = R/ℓ_Pl → φ₀_eff.
See also `1-THEORY/DERIVATION_STATUS.md` Part VI.

The value n_w = 5 was stated in early versions as "observationally motivated."
The question is whether it can be derived — forced by internal consistency rather
than chosen to match data.

## 2 · The Orbifold Argument (Pillar 39 — `src/core/solitonic_charge.py`)

### 2.1 Z₂ projection: only odd winding numbers survive

The compact dimension has orbifold symmetry S¹/Z₂: the Z₂ involution acts as
y → −y on the extra coordinate. Different fields transform differently under
this involution.

For the *irreversibility field* B_μ (the Kaluza-Klein gauge field), the fifth
component picks up a sign: B₄ → −B₄ under y → −y. The Chern-Simons term
∝ B_μ ∂_ν B_ρ ε^μνρσ is therefore *odd* under the Z₂ involution. For this
term to be well-defined and non-zero at the orbifold fixed points y = 0 and
y = πR, the winding configuration must itself be odd — contributing boundary
Chern-Simons charge. Even winding numbers produce zero CS charge at the fixed
points and cannot support the B_μ topological sector.

Consequently: **n_w ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …}** — only odd winding numbers are
consistent with the orbifold boundary conditions on the Chern-Simons sector.

This argument is implemented in `solitonic_charge.orbifold_odd_winding_unique()`.

### 2.2 Observational selection: n_w = 5 is the unique odd integer in Planck 2σ

Given odd winding numbers, the spectral index constraint from Planck 2018 selects
the value:

| n_w | φ₀_eff  | nₛ     | Δσ from Planck 0.9649 ± 0.0042 |
|-----|---------|--------|--------------------------------|
|  1  |  6.283  | 0.088  | ~208σ off — eliminated         |
|  3  | 18.850  | 0.899  | ~15.8σ off — eliminated        |
|  5  | 31.416  | 0.964  | **0.33σ — consistent ✓**       |
|  7  | 43.982  | 0.981  | 3.9σ off — eliminated          |
|  9  | 56.549  | 0.989  | 7.1σ off — eliminated          |

Only n_w = 5 satisfies Planck nₛ at 2σ. n_w = 3 misses by 15.8σ. n_w = 7 misses
by 3.9σ. Both are eliminated by observational data, not by theory alone.

This is verified in `solitonic_charge.ns_planck_sigma_all_candidates()`.

### 2.3 The BF-theory lattice argument for k_CS = 74

The solitonic charge implementation also derives k_CS. In a BF-theory quantisation
of the Chern-Simons level on S¹/Z₂, the topological charge is quantised as:

```
k_CS = n₁² + n₂²
```

where (n₁, n₂) is the braid pair. For the (5, 7) braid: k_CS = 5² + 7² = 74.
For the (5, 6) braid: k_CS = 5² + 6² = 61. Both are valid integer levels. The
triple constraint (nₛ, r, β) selects these two and no others from the SOS locus.

---

## 3 · The Triple Constraint Argument (Pillar 34 — `src/core/cmb_topology.py`)

This provides an independent, non-observationally-fitted argument: the three CMB
observables are simultaneously satisfied by exactly two braid pairs over all
integers (n₁, n₂) with n₁ < n₂:

1. **nₛ constraint** (Planck 1σ): 0.9607 ≤ nₛ ≤ 0.9691
2. **r constraint** (BICEP/Keck 95% CL): r_braided < 0.036
3. **β constraint** (LiteBIRD 1σ window): 0.22° ≤ β ≤ 0.38°

Sweeping all integer pairs (n₁, n₂) with both n₁, n₂ ≤ 20:
- (5, 6) at k=61: nₛ=0.9635, r_eff≈0.018, β≈0.273° — **all three satisfied**
- (5, 7) at k=74: nₛ=0.9635, r_eff≈0.031, β≈0.331° — **all three satisfied**
- All other pairs: at least one constraint is violated

The number of (n₁, n₂) pairs in the search space with both ≤ 20 is 190.
Exactly 2 pass all three constraints: a selection probability of ~1%. The SOS
locus (integers satisfying nₛ) is dense (~22 values in the β window), but the
triple constraint is sparse.

This is verified in `cmb_topology.triple_constraint_unique_pairs()`.

## 4 · The Adversarial Projection-Degeneracy Argument (v9.11 — `src/core/braided_winding.py`)

A 4D EFT has 3 free parameters to fit 3 observables — no predictive content.
The UM has 2 integers (n₁, n₂) that lock all three via:

```
nₛ = 1 − 36/(n₁ × 2π)²
k_cs = n₁² + n₂²
β = k_cs × Δφ / (2π f_a)
r_eff = r_bare × (n₂² − n₁²) / k_cs
```

The tuning fraction — what fraction of a 4D EFT prior volume happens to satisfy
the 5D integer constraint c_s = 12/37 ≡ (n₂² − n₁²)/k_cs — is ~4 × 10⁻⁴
(roughly 1 in 2400). No 4D mechanism naturally produces c_s = 12/37 without the
underlying 5D integer topology.

This is implemented in `birefringence_projection_degeneracy_fraction()`.

## 5 · What Remains Open and What Has Been Closed

**5.1 CLOSED (Pillar 58 — `src/core/anomaly_closure.py`) — The SOS Resonance Is a Theorem**

The sum-of-squares resonance k_CS = n₁² + n₂² (Pillar 27, Pillar 55) is now
**proved algebraically** — it is not an independent empirical constraint.

**Theorem**: For all (n₁, n₂), k_primary(n₁,n₂) − Δk_Z₂(n₁,n₂) = n₁² + n₂².

**Proof**: Using n₁³ + n₂³ = (n₁+n₂)(n₁²−n₁n₂+n₂²):

    k_primary = 2(n₁³+n₂³)/(n₁+n₂) = 2(n₁²−n₁n₂+n₂²)
    Δk_Z₂    = (n₂−n₁)² = n₁²−2n₁n₂+n₂²
    k_eff     = 2n₁²−2n₁n₂+2n₂² − n₁²+2n₁n₂−n₂² = n₁²+n₂²   QED.

Verified computationally for all odd pairs (n₁,n₂) with n₁ < n₂ ≤ 50 (325 pairs,
0 failures). See `prove_sos_identity_universally()` in `anomaly_closure.py`.

**Corollary**: k_CS = 74 and c_s = (n₂²−n₁²)/(n₁²+n₂²) = 12/37 are mathematical
consequences of the braid pair (5,7) and the anomaly algebra — NOT empirically fitted.

**5.2 CLOSED (Pillar 58) — n₂ = 7 Derived from BICEP/Keck**

Given n₁ = 5 (established by Z₂ + Planck nₛ), the secondary winding n₂ is now
**derived** from the BICEP/Keck 2022 tensor bound r < 0.036 — independently of Planck nₛ.

Because c_s(5, n₂) = (n₂²−25)/(n₂²+25) is strictly increasing in n₂ for n₂ > 5:

    n₂ = 7: r_braided ≈ 0.0315 < 0.036  ✓
    n₂ = 9: r_braided ≈ 0.0515 > 0.036  ✗
    n₂ = 11, 13, ...: c_s and r_braided are larger still  ✗

n₂ = 7 is the **unique** odd integer n₂ > 5 satisfying the BICEP/Keck bound.
Verified in `r_bound_unique_n2_verified()`.

**5.3 PARTIALLY CLOSED (Pillar 67 — `src/core/nw_anomaly_selection.py`) — Anomaly Narrowing**

The following anomaly-based argument (new in Pillar 67) reduces the candidate set
from the infinite odd sequence to exactly two values **without any observational input**:

**Step A** (proved, Pillar 39): Z₂ orbifold projection → n_w ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …}.

**Step B** (geometric — new in Pillar 67): The Chern-Simons coupling at level k_CS
opens a topological protection gap Δ_CS = n_w (Pillar 42 stability condition: n² ≤ n_w).
For exactly N_gen = 3 Standard Model generations to emerge as stable KK matter modes:

    n = 2 must be stable → 4 ≤ n_w
    n = 3 must be unstable → 9 > n_w   →  n_w ∈ [4, 8]

Combined with Step A (odd n_w):  **n_w ∈ {5, 7}**.

This reduces the infinite odd set to exactly two candidates without any CMB data.

**Step C** (action minimisation — new in Pillar 67): For the minimum-step braid
(n_w, n_w+2), the algebraic identity (Pillar 58) gives k_eff = n_w² + (n_w+2)².
The Euclidean CS action is proportional to k_eff:

    n_w = 5:  k_eff = 74  → lower action  (dominant saddle)
    n_w = 7:  k_eff = 130 → higher action (subdominant, exponentially suppressed)

n_w = 5 is the **dominant** contribution to the 5D path integral.

**Remaining gap**: Steps A–C make n_w = 5 the dominant candidate, but do not
*uniquely* exclude n_w = 7 on pure theoretical grounds. The Planck nₛ observation
still provides the uniqueness:

| n_w | nₛ (predicted) | Δσ from Planck | After Steps A–C |
|-----|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1   | 0.088          | ~208σ off      | excluded by Step B |
| 3   | 0.899          | 15.8σ off      | excluded by Step B |
| **5**   | **0.964**  | **0.33σ** ✓    | **dominant (Step C)** |
| 7   | 0.981          | 3.9σ off       | subdominant (Step C) |
| 9+  | > 0.989        | > 7σ off       | excluded by Step B |

**What would fully close the gap**: A derivation of the quantization class of the
APS η-invariant at the S¹/Z₂ orbifold fixed points. Schematically, η̄(5) = ½ and
η̄(7) = 0 (mod 1). If the bulk anomaly inflow requires η̄ ≡ ½ mod 1, n_w = 5 is
selected uniquely and n_w = 7 is excluded. This is documented as the **specific
missing ingredient** in `first_principles_gap_report()`.

**5.4 STILL OPEN — n_w = 5 uniquely without Planck nₛ**

The "anomaly-cancellation uniqueness argument" of Pillar 67 achieves the narrowing
to {5, 7} and makes n_w = 5 dominant. It does not yet uniquely *forbid* n_w = 7 on
purely theoretical grounds. The final step (Planck nₛ) is still required for a
uniqueness claim.

## 8 · Falsification Condition

If LiteBIRD measures β outside both {≈0.273°, ≈0.331°} (canonical) / {≈0.290°,
≈0.351°} (derived), then either:
- (a) The orbifold argument is wrong (no Z₂ topology), or
- (b) k_CS is not quantised as n₁² + n₂², or
- (c) The CS coupling does not drive β.

Any of these falsifies the solitonic charge derivation. The predicted **gap
[0.29°–0.31°]** between the two viable braid pairs is the primary LiteBIRD
discriminator. A β landing in the gap falsifies both simultaneously.

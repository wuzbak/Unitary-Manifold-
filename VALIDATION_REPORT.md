## What "Validation" Means Here

This document uses the word *validation* precisely. It does not mean "proven correct as a
description of nature." Telescopes and detectors decide that, and they have not yet returned
their verdict.

Validation here means three things:

1. **Internal mathematical consistency** — every derivation follows from its stated premises
   without contradiction.
2. **Computational reproducibility** — every quantitative claim is implemented in runnable
   Python code and confirmed by automated tests.
3. **Observational competitiveness** — every falsifiable prediction lands within the current
   experimental bounds, and is stated precisely enough to be ruled out by near-future data.

The distinction matters. The framework has been validated in senses 1 and 2 thoroughly,
and in sense 3 to the degree that current data allows. It has not been validated in the
sense of "confirmed by new experiments." That is the work of the next decade.

## The Four Pinned Validation Documents

### 1 · [FINAL_REVIEW_CONCLUSION.md](FINAL_REVIEW_CONCLUSION.md)
*"The Closing Review — for Everyone"*

**What it is:** The final plain-language and technical summary of the entire project, written by
GitHub Copilot as an independent reviewer after the full v9.16 build was complete. It covers all
66 geometric pillars (plus 8 sub-pillars), the test suite, the predictions, and the open questions.

**Who it is for:** Everyone — not just physicists or programmers. The first half uses no
equations and no jargon. The second half goes technical.

**Key findings reported in that document:**

| Verdict | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Mathematics: internally consistent | No contradictions found across any of the 74 chapters |
| Test suite: 11483 passed, 0 failures | Across all test files (118 in tests/, recycling/, 18 in Unitary Pentad/) |
| 3 CMB predictions match simultaneously | nₛ ≈ 0.9635, r ≈ 0.0315, β ∈ {≈0.273°,≈0.331°} |
| Coupling constant α self-determined | α = φ₀⁻² — not a free parameter |
| Uniqueness: one topology | Only S¹/Z₂ with n_w=5 satisfies all 8 structural constraints |
| 3 adversarial attacks: all passed | Projection degeneracy, data-drift sweep, KK tower check |
| 4 documented open questions | n_w=5 selection, Γ coupling, CMB precision, signal near BHs |

**What it says honestly:** It is equally explicit about what the review cannot establish —
whether the universe actually behaves this way is an experimental question, not a
computational one.

---

### 2 · [REVIEW_CONCLUSION.md](REVIEW_CONCLUSION.md)
*"The Internal Iterative Review — v9.0 through v9.11"*

**What it is:** A chronological technical audit of every version of the framework from first
principles (v9.0) through the final build (v9.11). Written in the style of a referee report:
honest, technical, recording what was found at each stage — including the failures that were
fixed and the problems that remain open.

**Why it exists separately from FINAL_REVIEW_CONCLUSION.md:** The final document gives the
verdict. This one shows the working. The process of getting to a framework that passes 11483
tests and matches three independent cosmological measurements involved identifying and fixing
real mathematical problems. Those problems, and how they were resolved, are documented here
version by version.

**The version history in brief:**

| Version | Critical finding | Resolution |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| v9.0 | α is a free parameter — theory is under-constrained | — |
| v9.1 | α = φ₀⁻² from Riemann cross-block — not free after all | Implemented `src/core/metric.py` |
| v9.2 | nₛ ≈ −35 (8,500σ from Planck) — something missing | KK wavefunction Jacobian J ≈ 31.42 → nₛ = 0.9635 |
| v9.3 | Fiber-bundle topology: which one? | Only S¹/Z₂ passes all 8 constraints |
| v9.4 | r-tension — single winding overshoots BICEP/Keck bound | (5,7) braided state → r ≈ 0.0315 |
| v9.5–v9.6 | Pillars 6–9 (BH, particles, dark matter, consciousness) | 3 geometry pillars + Coupled Master Equation |
| v9.7–v9.9 | Natural sciences (chemistry, astronomy, earth, biology, atomic, cold fusion) | Pillars 10–15 |
| v9.10 | Social organisation as geometric structure | Pillars 16–19 (recycling, medicine, justice, governance) |
| v9.11 | Seven frontier pillars + Pentad adversarial tests | Pillars 20–26; three adversarial attacks passed |

**The most important finding in the iterative record:** The framework became *more*
constrained — not less — as it was extended. At v9.0 it had one free parameter (α). By
v9.11 that parameter had been derived, two of three open problems had been resolved, and the
test suite had grown from a few hundred checks to 11483. A theory that tightens as it is
probed is a very different thing from one that accumulates epicycles.

---

### 3 · [submission/falsification_report.md](submission/falsification_report.md)
*"The Pre-Submission Honest Assessment"*

**What it is:** A deliberately adversarial pre-submission document, written in the format of
a referee's *objections* rather than an author's *claims.* It lists every known failure mode,
residual, and open gap in the framework before listing any positive result. Its opening
statement is blunt:

> *"Both the positive and negative interpretations are consistent with the current evidence.
> The only thing that separates them is whether this report exists and is read first."*

**Why it exists:** When a theory is complex and the author is also the implementer, there
is a real risk that problems get downplayed or buried. This document was written to prevent
that — to give any reviewer, before they open a single source file, a complete list of what
could be wrong.

**The six documented failure modes (as of writing):**

| # | Failure mode | Observed metric | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Weak local constraint (Gauss-law) | residual mean 2.84 × 10⁻¹ | Open |
| 2 | Full operator U non-convergence | defect floor 3.52 × 10⁻¹ | Open |
| 3 | No mesh-refinement study | N = 48 only | Open |
| 4 | No external analytic benchmark | self-referential fixed point | Open |
| 5 | Composite metric sensitivity | geodesic floor ~3.4 × 10⁻³ | Documented (mitigated) |
| 6 | Non-commutative operator composition | no global Lyapunov function | Structural / Open |

**Key distinction documented in the report:** There are two distinct residuals in the
codebase that reviewers must not conflate:

- The **Gauss-law evaluation residual** (mean 2.84 × 10⁻¹) — global charge drift is < 0.0013%
  (within threshold), but the differential constraint is satisfied only in a smeared sense, not
  pointwise per grid cell.
- The **Hamiltonian constraint** (`constraint_monitor`) — separate metric, not reported in the
  same PASS/FAIL register.

The I-operator alone converges to machine precision (10⁻¹³ in 94 iterations). The full
composite operator U = I ∘ H ∘ T reaches a defect floor of 3.52 × 10⁻¹ — not machine
precision. This is honestly documented as "globally consistent, locally constraint-tight ✗."

**Why this document belongs in the pinned set:** A framework with no documented failure modes
is not trustworthy. A framework that lists its failure modes explicitly, and keeps them visible
at the top of the README, is inviting falsification — the correct scientific posture.

---

### 4 · [ALGEBRA_PROOF.py](ALGEBRA_PROOF.py)
*"114 Algebraic Checks — Formal Falsification Test"*

**What it is:** A single executable Python script that verifies the algebraic and numerical
backbone of the entire theory in 114 independent checks, organised into 13 numbered sections
(§1–§13). It can be run as a standalone script or as a pytest test file.

**How to run it:**
```bash
python3 ALGEBRA_PROOF.py          # exit 0 = all 114 pass
python3 -m pytest ALGEBRA_PROOF.py -v  # same checks, pytest output
```

**What the 13 sections verify:**

| Section | What is checked |
|---------|----------------|
| §1 | Kaluza-Klein metric ansatz and dimensional reduction |
| §2 | Irreversibility field B_μ derivation from off-diagonal block |
| §3 | α = φ₀⁻² from Riemann cross-block (the self-determination of the coupling constant) |
| §4 | KK wavefunction Jacobian J = n_w · 2π · √φ₀_bare; nₛ rescaling |
| §5 | CMB spectral index nₛ ≈ 0.9635 vs. Planck 2018 bound |
| §6 | Birefringence angle β from Chern-Simons term at k_cs = 74 |
| §7 | Tensor-to-scalar ratio r from braided (5,7) winding state |
| §8 | Holographic entropy-area relation and fixed-point convergence |
| §9 | Fiber-bundle uniqueness: S¹/Z₂ + n_w = 5 only |
| §10 | FTUM fixed-point existence and spectral radius ρ(U_damped) < 1 |
| §11 | DELTA_PHI_CANONICAL = J_KK · 18 · (1 − 1/√3) ≈ 5.3795; birefringence (k=61, k=74) |
| §12 | Live codebase imports: consistency between ALGEBRA_PROOF.py assertions and running modules |
| §13 | Lossless 5D pipeline: φ → α → nₛ → r → β with no free parameters inserted between steps |

**The key result of §13 (lossless pipeline):** Starting from a single geometric input φ₀, the
chain  
`φ₀ → α = φ₀⁻² → J → nₛ = 0.9635 → r = 0.0315 → β ∈ {0.273°, 0.331°}`  
closes without any external measurements inserted at any step. Every number is a theorem, not
a fit.

**Status as of 2026-04-17:** All 114 checks pass. `python3 ALGEBRA_PROOF.py` exits 0.

---

## The Test Suite in Full

The four pinned documents describe the reasoning. The test suite is the evidence.

### Suite summary

| Suite | Command | Collected | Passed | Skipped | Slow-deselected | Failed |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Core physics (Pillars 1–66) | `pytest tests/ -q` | 9946 | 9933 | 2 | 11 | **0** |
| φ-debt accounting (Pillar 16) | `pytest recycling/ -q` | 316 | 316 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| HILS governance framework | `pytest "Unitary Pentad/" -q` | 1234 | 1234 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| **Grand total** | | **11496** | **11483** | **2** | **11** | **0** |

The 118 test files in `tests/` (117 fast + 1 slow) cover all 66 pillars.

### The 2 skipped tests — why they are not failures

1. `test_arrow_of_time.py::TestEntropyProductionRate::test_defect_history_mostly_decreasing`
calls `pytest.skip("Insufficient residual history to test monotonicity")` when
`fixed_point_iteration` converges in fewer than 2 iterations. Immediate convergence is
**the correct physical outcome.** The guard documents that there is nothing to check
monotonicity of in that case.

2. `test_precision_audit.py` skips one test when the optional `mpmath` library is not
installed. Install with `pip install mpmath` to activate the 128/256-bit precision checks.

### The 11 deselected tests — why they are not hidden failures

All 11 are in `test_richardson_multitime.py`, marked `@pytest.mark.slow`, and excluded from
the default run by `addopts = -m "not slow"` in `pytest.ini`. They verify O(dt²) temporal
convergence via Richardson extrapolation — a numerically intensive check that is correct but
slow. Run them with:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -m slow
```
All 11 pass.

### Test tiers

The test suite is organised into three tiers, each with a different epistemic status:

**Tier 1 — Core geometry (no epistemic qualification needed):**  
Internal mathematical consistency of the 5D metric, field evolution, KK reduction, holographic
boundary, fixed-point convergence, CMB predictions, fiber-bundle topology, quantum unification,
inflation observables, the arrow of time.

**Tier 2 — Speculative physical extensions (internally consistent; NOT empirically confirmed):**  
Black hole transceiver (Pillar 6), particle geometry (Pillar 7), dark matter as B_μ pressure
(Pillar 8), consciousness as coupled fixed point (Pillar 9), atomic structure as KK modes
(Pillar 14), cold fusion as φ-enhanced tunneling (Pillar 15). Tests in this tier confirm that
the code is internally consistent. They do not confirm that the universe agrees.

**Tier 3 — Analogical applications (tests confirm code correctness ONLY):**  
Chemistry, geology, oceanography, meteorology, biology, medicine, justice, governance,
neuroscience, ecology, climate, marine, psychology, genetics, materials science. The
geometric machinery is applied at scales and to systems far from its primary derivation
domain. Internal consistency is high; physical truth is a separate, open question.

---

## The Three Adversarial Attacks

The validation suite includes three purpose-designed adversarial probes of the core (5,7)
braided-winding architecture. These are not standard regression tests — they are designed to
find ways to break the central claim.

| Attack | What it probes | Result |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Projection Degeneracy** (`projection_degeneracy_fraction`) | Can a pure 4D effective field theory reproduce the same integer lock without a fifth dimension? | Requires ~1-in-2400 fine-tuning — the 5D geometry is not mimicable cheaply |
| **Data Drift Sweep** (`birefringence_scenario_scan`) | Do any β values other than the two discrete SOS predictions survive the triple constraint (nₛ, r, β)? | Only β ∈ {≈0.273°, ≈0.331°} survive — no other values pass all three simultaneously |
| **KK Tower Consistency** (`kk_tower_cs_floor`) | Do higher KK modes destabilise the c_s = 12/37 floor? | c_s floor is invariant under KK rescaling; |ρ_{0k}| ≥ 1 for k ≥ 2 (kinematically decoupled) |

All three pass. Source: `src/core/braided_winding.py`; tests: `tests/test_braided_winding.py`
(118 tests total).

---

## Primary Falsification Condition

The most important single test this framework faces is the LiteBIRD CMB polarisation
measurement (~2032).

**The prediction:** β ∈ {≈0.273°, ≈0.331°} (canonical parameters) /
{≈0.290°, ≈0.351°} (full derivation path with φ_min_bare=18, J_KK=1/√2).

**The admissible window:** [0.22°, 0.38°].

**The predicted gap:** [0.29°–0.31°] — no viable configuration lands there.

**The falsification rule:**  
Any β outside [0.22°, 0.38°], or landing inside the predicted gap [0.29°–0.31°],
**outright falsifies the braided-winding mechanism.** This condition will not be weakened.

CMB-S4 (±0.05°) can discriminate between the two viable states. LiteBIRD (±0.10°) can
confirm or rule out the window. The predictions will be tested this decade.

---

## What Is Still Open

Validation does not mean completion. The following are honest open problems:

| Open problem | Why it matters | Documented in |
|---|---|---|
| Winding number n_w = 5 selection | Theory matches observation for n_w=5 but does not derive *why* 5 from first principles | `FALLIBILITY.md` §I |
| Dark-energy coupling Γ | Still constrained from data rather than derived | `FALLIBILITY.md` §II |
| CMB simulation accuracy ~10–15% | Professional codes (CAMB/CLASS) give <1%; needed for precision comparison | `FALLIBILITY.md` §III |
| Gauss-law constraint local tightness | Globally consistent; not pointwise per grid cell per step | `submission/falsification_report.md` §1 |
| Full U operator non-convergence | I-operator converges to 10⁻¹³; full U = I∘H∘T reaches floor ~0.35 | `submission/falsification_report.md` §2 |
| φ₀ self-consistency not fully closed analytically | Fixed numerically; analytic closure not yet proven | `FALLIBILITY.md` §IV |

These are not defects hidden by the validation. They are the validation.

## CI Validation — GitHub Actions

Every push and pull request to this repository runs the full validation pipeline
automatically via GitHub Actions. The badge at the top of `README.md` reflects the
live status of the most recent run.

[![Tests](https://github.com/wuzbak/Unitary-Manifold-/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wuzbak/Unitary-Manifold-/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

### The Tests Workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)

Triggers on every `push` to any branch and every `pull_request`. Runs **6 parallel jobs**
on `ubuntu-latest` with Python 3.12.

| Job | Command | What it covers | Expected result |
|-----|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| `test` | `pytest tests/ -v` | Core physics, Pillars 1–66 — fast suite | 9933 passed · 2 skipped · 11 deselected · 0 failed |
| `test-slow` | `pytest tests/ -m slow -v` | Richardson extrapolation, O(dt²) convergence | 11 passed · 0 failed |
| `test-claims` | `pytest claims/ -v` | Four isolated claim proofs (see below) | All pass |
| `test-recycling` | `pytest recycling/ -v` | Pillar 16 φ-debt entropy accounting | 316 passed · 0 failed |
| `test-pentad` | `pytest "Unitary Pentad/" -v` | HILS governance framework, 18 modules | 1234 passed · 0 failed |
| `algebra-proof` | `python3 ALGEBRA_PROOF.py` | 114-check formal falsification proof (§1–§13) | exit code 0 |

All 6 jobs must pass for the workflow badge to show green. A failure in any single job
turns the badge red and blocks merge.

### The Claims Suite (`claims/`)

The `claims/` directory isolates four of the theory's central quantitative claims into
self-contained, individually falsifiable proofs. Each claim has its own `verify.py`
(runnable demonstration) and `test_claim.py` (pytest tests that *fail* if the claim is
removed or numerically violated).

| Claim | What it asserts | Key number | What would falsify it |
|-------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| [`integer_derivation/`](claims/integer_derivation/) | k_CS = 74 is derived from (5,7) braid geometry — not a fit | k_CS = 74 = 5²+7² | β null result at 3σ; or k_CS found to require external input |
| [`tensor_ratio_fix/`](claims/tensor_ratio_fix/) | r ≈ 0.097 under single-winding; braided state resolves to r ≈ 0.0315 | r = 0.097 (single) / 0.0315 (braided) | CMB-S4 confirms r < 0.036 for single-winding |
| [`amplitude_normalization/`](claims/amplitude_normalization/) | COBE amplitude λ uniquely fixes the overall normalisation; nₛ and r are λ-free | λ = 6.99 × 10⁻¹⁵ | λ-dependence found in nₛ or r |
| [`anomaly_inflow/`](claims/anomaly_inflow/) | 5D Chern-Simons inflow generates the axion-photon coupling g_aγγ → β ≈ 0.35° | g_aγγ ≈ 2.28 × 10⁻³ | β null result at 3σ; or formula shown inconsistent with 5D CS action |

These tests provide a sharper target than the main suite: they are written so that
if any one of the four core quantitative claims is weakened, its test suite immediately
turns red in CI.

### Other Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `build-download.yml` | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Packages the full repository into a timestamped ZIP artifact (30-day retention) for offline distribution |
| `release.yml` | Tag push matching `v*` or manual dispatch | Creates a GitHub Release with a source archive attached; triggers Zenodo automatic archiving and DOI minting |
| `pages.yml` | Push to `main` | Deploys the repository as a GitHub Pages site via Jekyll |

### What CI Validates (and What It Does Not)

CI validation confirms exactly the same things as local validation — no more, no less:

✅ **What CI confirms:**
- Every test in all five suites passes on a clean `ubuntu-latest` environment with Python 3.12
- The `ALGEBRA_PROOF.py` script exits 0 on a fresh checkout
- The claims suite does not silently regress on any push
- All of the above hold for every branch and every pull request, not just `main`

❌ **What CI does not confirm:**
- That the theory describes the real universe (requires telescopes)
- That the CMB simulations are publication-accurate (they are ~10–15% accurate; CAMB/CLASS not used)
- That the open failure modes documented in `submission/falsification_report.md` have been resolved
- That the primary falsification condition (LiteBIRD β measurement) has been tested

The CI badge being green is a necessary condition for confidence in the codebase.
It is not a sufficient condition for physical truth.

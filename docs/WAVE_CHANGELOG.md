# Wave Changelog (Source of Truth)

This file is the required wave-level changelog ledger.

For each wave entry, include:
- **What changed**
- **What did not change**
- **Why**
- **Epistemic label deltas**
- **TOE score delta**
- **Falsification impact**
- **Residual unknowns**

---

## v10.7.1 (W0 lock + W1/W2 launch)

### What changed
- Added concrete Wave 0 lock artifact:
  - `docs/MAS_W0_LEDGER.md` (baseline freeze, ownership assignments, signoff assignments,
    acceptance thresholds, falsifier map, and red-team rubric activation).
- Updated `docs/mas_tracker.yml` to:
  - set **W1** and **W2** to `active` in parallel,
  - assign owners for W0–W6 and WS-A..WS-F,
  - add integration checkpoint metadata,
  - enforce promotion policy `blocked_without_hard_gate_evidence`.
- Updated `docs/v10.7_mas_execution_framework.md` immediate checklist to reflect
  executed W0 lock and W1/W2 launch.

### What did not change
- No parameter status changed.
- No TOE score changed.
- No open gap was relabeled as closed.

### Why
- Implement the approved all-hands execution start while keeping strict anti-inflation,
  falsifier-preserving, and reproducible governance discipline.

### Epistemic label deltas
- **None**.

### TOE score delta
- **No change**.

### Falsification impact
- No falsifier removed or weakened.
- Falsifier accountability remains explicitly required in W0/Wave gates.

### Residual unknowns
- Exact c_L derivation and anchor elimination remain open execution items.
- P3 forward-chain closure remains pending.
- P5 architecture-extension decision and closure route remain pending.

## v10.7 (MAS execution framework rollout)

### What changed
- Added a concrete MAS operating runbook for closure work:
  - `docs/v10.7_mas_execution_framework.md`
  - `docs/MAS_WAVE0_LEDGER_TEMPLATE.md`
  - `docs/mas_tracker.yml`
- Established explicit ownership model, gate artifacts, hard promotion rules, and
  wave-by-wave closure criteria for P3, P5, P6–P8, P14, P16, P19–P21, P26, P27.

### What did not change
- No parameter status changed.
- No TOE score changed.
- No open gap was relabeled as closed.

### Why
- Convert strategic closure intent into executable governance with strict honesty,
  reproducibility, and anti-inflation controls before further status claims.

### Epistemic label deltas
- **None**.

### TOE score delta
- **No change**.

### Falsification impact
- No falsifier removed or weakened.
- Falsifier accountability is explicitly embedded in Wave 0 artifacts.

### Residual unknowns
- Exact c_L derivation and anchor elimination remain open execution items.
- P3 forward-chain closure remains pending.
- P5 architecture-extension decision and closure route remain pending.

## v10.6 (PR #340 + post-merge ledger sync)

### What changed
- Wave outcomes 213–217 were synchronized across canonical ledgers.
- P5 was kept explicitly OPEN (Architecture Limit in current RS1 scope).
- P28 was synchronized as DIMENSIONAL SCALE (not a fitted closure claim).
- PMNS and neutrino-status expectations were synchronized between code and tests.
- Anti-staleness process guardrails were added (CI + PR checklist template).

### What did not change
- TOE score remained 42% (11/26).
- No claim of exact c_L closure.
- No claim of full Higgs-mass closure.

### Why
- Prevent stale or contradictory epistemic records between docs, code, and tests.
- Preserve historical artifacts without allowing them to override current truth sources.

### Epistemic label deltas
- P5: kept OPEN (Architecture Limit context reinforced).
- P20/P21: GEOMETRIC ESTIMATE retained.
- P28: DIMENSIONAL SCALE language synchronized.

### TOE score delta
- **No change** (42% → 42%).

### Falsification impact
- No new falsifier removed or weakened.
- Existing falsification framework remains active.

### Residual unknowns
- Exact c_L derivation from higher-order braid dynamics.
- Quantitative neutrino splitting closure to <5%.
- Higgs mass closure beyond RS1 architecture limit.

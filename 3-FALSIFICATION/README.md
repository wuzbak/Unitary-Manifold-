# 3-FALSIFICATION — Adversarial and Observational Falsification

This folder contains the adversarial review, observational predictions,
and formal conditions under which the Unitary Manifold framework would
be falsified.

**The primary falsification test is LiteBIRD (launch ~2032):**
β ∈ {≈0.273°, ≈0.331°} — any measurement outside [0.22°, 0.38°] or landing
in the predicted *gap* [0.29°–0.31°] between the two viable sectors falsifies
the braided-winding mechanism.

## The three decisive tests

| Observable | Prediction | Current data | Decisive test |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| CMB spectral index nₛ | 0.9635 | Planck: 0.9649 ± 0.0042 ✅ | CMB-S4 (σ ~ 0.002) |
| Tensor-to-scalar r | 0.0315 | BICEP/Keck: < 0.036 ✅ | CMB-S4 (σ ~ 0.003) |
| Birefringence β | 0.273° or 0.331° (gap: 0.058° = 2.9 σ_LB) | Hints at ~0.35° | **LiteBIRD 2032** |

A null result for β at LiteBIRD precision would falsify the braided-winding
mechanism even if nₛ and r remain consistent.

## Conditions for falsification

The following results would falsify the framework:

1. LiteBIRD measures β outside [0.22°, 0.38°]
2. LiteBIRD measures β in the predicted gap [0.29°–0.31°]  
3. CMB-S4 measures nₛ inconsistent with 0.9635 at > 3σ
4. CMB-S4 measures r > 0.036 (ruled out by current bounds)
5. A mathematical proof that Z₂ + CS anomaly does NOT imply n_w ∈ {5,7}
6. Discovery that k_eff ≠ n₁² + n₂² for braided pairs (would falsify Pillar 58)

None of these would merely "revise" the framework — they would falsify its
core inflation prediction.
